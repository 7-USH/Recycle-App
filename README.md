## Description
Recycling App is an android application that provides information to user about recyclable items that are available in nearby places and also allows the user to inform other users about the recyclable items the user has.
To fulfill the rising demands for metals, it is critical to identify new sources of raw materials, and one of the most important sources of raw materials is recycling. This app helps in notifying the nearby recycling facilities and also the people who are willing to recycle things to get information about user uploaded data about products which are recyclable.
